Optimization Technics
  Minification - Removing comments and white spaces
  Uglification - Renaming long descriptive function names into short names
  Bundling - Combining multiple js files into one
  Dead code elimination - removing codes that are not used in the app
  Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation - precompiling angular components and templates to improve app performance


JIT vs AOT compilation
  Angular Compiler - takes js code and converts to js code
  JIT (Just-in-time)
    Compilation at run-time
    Need to ship angular compiler; vendor bundle
  AOT (Ahead-of-time)
    Compile ahead of time before deploying app
    Catch template errors earlier
    Better Security
  Angular Compiler in action
    creates a factory file
  Building Applications with Angular Compilation
    ng build
    ng build --prod
  Environments
    Development
    Test
    Production
  Adding custom Environments
    modify the angular.json file
    ng serve --environment=test
  Linting with Angular CLI
    tslint - Linter
    ng lint --fix
  Other deployment options
    Github pages
    Firebase
    Heroku
    Azure
  Engines

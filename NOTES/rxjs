RxJS - What and Why?

  RxJS is a library for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback based code
  Funnel like approach makes it easier to to write structured statements handling asynchronous code and the operators we can use in that funnel to transform the data


OBSERVABLES, OBSERVERS & SUBSCRIPTIONS | RxJS TUTORIAL
  Observables
    It is a wrapper around some data source (a stream of values)(asynchronous or synchronous data)
  Observer
    We want to do something when a new value occurs - That is the job of the observer
    Observer executes a code whenever we receive a new value, an error, or when done
    Observer subscribes to a Observable
    It has 3 methods
      next(), error(), complete()

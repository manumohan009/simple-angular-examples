Shadow DOM
  It is a separate DOM tree of elements that you can create which is not the part of the main DOM.
  When you render it behaves like it is part of the main DOM
  Creating a shadow DOM
    var host = document.querySelector('#shadowHost')
    var shadowRoot = host.createShadowRoot();


CSS units - rem, em, vh, wh
  pixels are fixed units. 12 px always 12px no matter what
  rem and em are relative and difference is what they are relative to
    both are relative to font sizes
    rem
      is always relative to root element html
      if you change the default font size (16px by default) in browser settings, it is reflected; if we use px instead, browser settings has no effect;
      by default 1 rem = 16px
      font-size: 1rem = 1 x font-size specified on the html element

    em
      is always relative to parent element
      browser settings has effect on this too

    vh - viewport height
      is always relative to the browser height
      50vh - 50% of browser height
    wh - viewport width
      is always relative to the browser width
      50vh - 50% of browser width


Adaptive design and Responsive design
Adaptive design
  content follows a fixed layout size in adaptive design
  adaptive design uses a few fixed layouts, and then selects the best layout for the current screen size
  developing six designs for the six most common screen widths—320, 480, 760, 960, 1200, and 1600 pixels—is standard practice for designers
Responsive design
  it moves dynamically in responsive design
  responsive design uses a single layout, which resizes according to the screen size

The Three Major Principles of Responsive Design
  Fluid Grid Systems
  Fluid Image Use
  Media Queries

Unit Testing
  What is Automated Testing ?
    Practice of writing code to test our code and run those test in an automated fashion
    It helps you catch defects before releasing your software
  Types of tests
    Unit Testing
      Test a component in isolation, without external resources(eg. filesystem, database, API endpoints)
      Use Fake service, Fake router etc
      Easiest to write, super fast, don't give us much confidence
    Integration Testing
      Test a component with external resources (eg. filesystem, database, API endpoints)
    End-to-End Testing
      Test the entire app as a whole
